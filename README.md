# `test-wasm-bindgen`

A small reproduction of a bug I've been unable to crack. To illicit the bug:

Build with

```
cargo install wasm-pack
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 wasm-pack build --target web
```
```

This seems to have popped up from time to time in `wasm-bindgen`'s history with,
seemingly resolved by matching dependency versions (
[#3441](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/3441), 
[#2776](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/2776), among others).

## Troubleshooting

* Build error only arises when `IntoWasmAbi`/`FromWasmAbi` are implemented for 
  a new type.
* As far as I can tell, dependency versions are all the same. I've tried many 
  of the older versions that resolved previous issues to no avail 
  (`0.2.78`, `0.2.79`, `0.2.84`).
* Attempted reinstalling `wasm-pack` with `wasm-pack --locked` to no avail
